    "# Principal Component Analysis\n",
    "Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique to project data from higher dimension ($D$) to a lower dimension ($M$). There are a few reasons for why this is a good idea. It can, for example be a good pre-processing step for supervised classification or regression. Another reason to project the data to lower dimension is to visualize the data.\n",

    ">\n",
    ">Usually when the elements in the data vectors are connected (for example when they represent a signal of some sort) the PCA components provide a good insight into how the data looks like. Popular example of this is when the data \"vector\" is a facial image. This two-dimensional signal can be broken down into PCA components which are called \"eigenfaces\". An example of this can be seen [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_face_recognition.html).\n",
