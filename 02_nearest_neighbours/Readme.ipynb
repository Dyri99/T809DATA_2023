    "The aim of this exercise is to implement the KNN algorithm and evaluate using cross-validation on the Iris data set. The implementation will also be evaluated by comparing it with the scikit-learn implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1.\n",
    "The first step is to implement the kNN algorithm. The kNN algorithm uses a distance calculation of some sort to determine which points are neighbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `tools.plot_points()` to see a scatter plot of the first two dimensions of all points in the Iris set:\n",

    "d, t, classes = load_iris()\n",
    "plot_points(d, t)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in the following image\n",

    "### Part 1.1\n",
    "Implement a distance calculation so that we get the distance between a specific point to all the other points in the set. Use the [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance):\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x^{train~n}$ is the $n$-th vector in the training set. The outcome of this step is a vector containing all the distances $d_n$.\n",

    "Create a function `euclidian_distance(x, y)` that calculates the euclidian distance between `x` and `y`.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1.3\n",
    "The next step in the algorithm is to find the $k$ nearest point to `x`. Using your `euclidian_distances`, create a function `k_nearest(x, points, k)` that returns the indices of the $k$ nearest points.\n",

    "**Hint:** Use `np.argsort`\n",

    "### Part 1.4\n",
    "The final step in the kNN algorithm is the vote. After finding $k$-nearest points, we vote for the most common class label among the nearest points.\n",

    "Create a function `knn_predict(points, point_targets, classes, k)` which uses your `knn` function to predict a class label for each point in `points`. `help.remove_one(points, i)` might be helpful here.

    "Based on the examples above, it seems like the choice of `k` is an important influence on the accuracy of the classifier. We therefore want to pick a good value of $k$, but how?\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to do this is to evaluate multiple values of $k$ on the training set and pick the one that works best. Create a function `best_k(points, point_targets, classes)` that returns the value of $k$ that corresponds to the highest accuracy on the point set. You should test values of $K$ in the interval $[1, N-1]$ where $N$ is the number of points in the point set.\n",
