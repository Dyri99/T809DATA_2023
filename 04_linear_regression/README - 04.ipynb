    "# Linear Models for Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have tried to *classify* flowers from the Iris dataset. Classification tasks assume that we have a set of *features* and a set of *class labels* that we would like our models to learn to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression tasks don't assume categorical labels. In regression tasks we again have some set of *features* but the value we want to predict isn't a label anymore but some value from a continuous domain. Therefore the the output domain of the model is continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can for example imagine the quadratic equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    y = ax^2 + bx + c\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a regression task might be to predict what $a, b, c$ are given a feature set of multiple $(x, y)$ values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we will be using a altered version of the Iris dataset were we have ditched the class label targets and replaced them with the last feature column (representing the pedal length of the flower). You can load this data with `tools.load_regression_iris`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 1\n",
    "We are going to use the Gaussian basis functions to predict real valued target variables of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\phi_k(x) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{D/2}} \\frac{1}{|\\Sigma_k|^{1/2}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} (x-\\mu_k)^T \\Sigma_k^{-1} (x-\\mu_k)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We control the shift of the basis function using the mean vector $\\mu_k$  but we force all covariance matrices to be identical and diagonal $\\Sigma_k = \\sigma\\mathbf{I}$ for all $k$ so $\\sigma$ is the parameter that controls the width of all the basis functions (in all directions).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 1.1\n",
    "Create a function `mvn_basis(features, mu, sigma)` that applies the multivariate normal basis function on the set of features. You should use `scipy.stats.multivariate_normal` to create your multivariate gaussians.\n",
