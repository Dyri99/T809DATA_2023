    "# K-means Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise focuses on assigning categorical values using unsupervised learning by implement our own *K-means clustering*  algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will apply the method to the Iris database and the results of the clustering is then compared to the target values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 1 - K-means Clustering\n",
    "The focus here is to implement the [K-means algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) and evaluate it's performance on the Iris dataset. (See Chapter 9.1 in Bishop).\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm aims to split $n$ samples $(x_1, x_2, ... x_n)$ into $k$ clusters where each sample belongs to the cluster which mean is closest to the sample. These means are referred to as *prototypes*  $(\\mu_1, \\mu_2, ... \\mu_k)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-means algorithm has the following steps:\n",
    "1. Initialize the *k* prototypes. Typically these are chosen at random from the set of samples.\n",
    "2. *E-step*:\n",
    "    * Calculate the *distance matrix* ($D$) of size $[n \\times k]$. Element $D[i, j]$ is the euclidean distance between sample $i$ and prototype $j$.\n",
    "    * Determine $r_{nk}$ for each point $x_n$. We set $r_{nk}=1$ and $r_{nj}=0, j\\neq k$ if we decided $x_n$ belongs to $k$. Typically we make this\n",
    "    determination by choosing the $\\mu_k$ closest to $x_n$.\n",
    "3. We then calculate the value of $J$, our objective function:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "        J  = \\sum_{n=1}^N \\sum_{k=1}^K r_{nk} ||x_n - \\mu_k ||^2\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "   our goal is to find values for all $r_{nk}$ and all $\\mu_k$ (our parameters) to minimize the value of $J$.\n",
    "   Here, we will be using the average distance from the points to their cluster means as the objective value (let's call it $\\hat{J}$).\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\hat{J} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^N \\sum_{k=1}^K r_{nk} || x_n - \\mu_k ||\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "4. *M-step* We now recompute the value of the prototypes:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "        \\mu_k = \\frac{\\sum_n r_{nk} x_n}{\\sum_n r_{nk}}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "5. Compare the current value of $\\hat{J}$ to the previous value of $\\hat{J}$. If the difference is above a certain threshold, we perform steps 2-4 again. Otherwise we continue up to a maximum number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
