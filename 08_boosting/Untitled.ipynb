    "\n",
    "In this exercise we'll use boosting on the Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](kaggle.com). The dataset, demos and discussions on the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). The raw titanic data can be accessed via `tools.get_titanic`\n",
    "\n",
    "To use boosting, we will use the `GradientBoostingClassifier` in `sklearn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the pandas library to organize and clean up the data. The data we're given here has quite a few defects (which is quite common when dealing with real data) and we need to fix and clean it up before we do our predictions. A cheat-sheet for pandas can be found [here](http://datacamp-community-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/dbed353d-2757-4617-8206-8767ab379ab3)\n",

    "**About the Titanic Dataset**:\n",
    "This dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic. It also contains information about which passengers survived the shipwreck and which didn't. This dataset is often used to train models to predict from passenger information which passengers survived and which didn't.\n",
